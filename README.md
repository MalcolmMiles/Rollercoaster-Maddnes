This was my first project I have done and learned the most from!!!

So I kinda diverted to a different manner of studying and I'm going through Kaggle data. I'm getting a hang of the process and it's not that hard I just need to practice it a bit more and it's kind of exciting, I'm using a very helpful resource on youtube ROB MULLA. He's breaking down the process pretty well and I'm confident I can finish the project by the end of the day and eventually get started on a second one.

So I completed my first project successfully I didn't really have a question I wanted to ask while writing so I just started looking through data and had an idea of what I wanted to search.

It should go without being said that I struggled through but I'm glad I completed it. I thank stackoverflow and ROB MULLA for helping me get through it because lord it was difficult I had a bunch of issues left and right and I was confused on multiple occasions. but I honestly

learned a lot through this entire process and after this break, I'll be ready to start another one. We are excited to announce the launch of our new project!
